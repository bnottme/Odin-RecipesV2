# Odin Recipes V2
* A simple HTML-based webpage built to showcase recipes, created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. This project demonstrates foundational HTML skills and serves as a base for future enhancements with CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Overview
* This project was developed to apply and reinforce my understanding of core HTML concepts. It includes multiple linked recipe pages and displays images, lists, and structured content effectively.

## What I Learned
* How to use the <a> (anchor) element to link between HTML pages.

* How to display images using the <img> element and apply attributes such as alt, height, and width.

* The difference between ordered (<ol>) and unordered (<ul>) lists, and how to implement them.

* The use of semantic HTML elements like <header>, <p> (paragraph), and others for organizing content properly.

## Future Plans
* Style the project using CSS for improved visual design.
* Add JavaScript for interactivity and enhanced functionality.
