    <p>Symphony bars were Aunt Judy’s secret weapon. You know, the fancy Hershey bar with the classy font on the wrapper. The simple one-ingredient upgrade makes a regular boxed brownie mix taste homemade. <br>

        If you’re not familiar, here’s some background: Symphony is the name of two types of chocolate bars made by The Hershey Company (one is plain, the other has toffee and almonds).<br> The ingredients are the same as regular Hershey’s milk chocolate, but they’re used in different amounts. The result is a milkier, creamier flavor and texture that melts beautifully into batter. 
        
        <br>Aunt Judy used the toffee-almond bars and I think she had the right idea. But, if you’re baking for a picky eater or someone with allergies, the smooth chocolate makes amazing brownies too. </p>
