        <br>
        <li>

            20 minutes, turning filets over halfway through heating time. When cool enou <br>
            to handle, cut filets into bite-sized pieces.
        </li>

            baked, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven. Spray cooking spray on the bottom <br>
            of a cup. Smash each tater tot into a flat disk with cup. 
        </li>
        <br>

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>

            minutes.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, whisk Caesar dressing, lemon juice, anchovy paste, garlic, 1/4 <br>
            teaspoon black pepper, and salt together in a bowl until smooth.
        </li>

        <li>
            Toss together lettuce, chicken, remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and <br>
            remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper until well combined. Pour half the <br>
            dressing into salad mix and toss until evenly coated. Add cooled tater tots and <br>
            toss until well combined.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Transfer to a serving platter, drizzle with white balsamic vinegar, and garnish <br>
            with more Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately.
